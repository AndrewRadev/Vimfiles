ccimpl.vim needs to be able to generate skeletons for existing cpp files as well.
Need to learn how to use bg.vim
Think of a general outline (indentation?) and some specific ones here and there:
  * "::" in Haskell?
  * "def" in Python and Ruby?

Symfony
  * Glob for models recursively (prefix with dir?)
  * automatically infer app in Econtroller whenever possible

Dbext:
  * Mappings
  * Window placement
  * Install perl + CPAN stuff

PHP:
  * Hack the ctags php parser.
  * Experiment with refactoring -- look through TRag
  * ".xml.php" -- XML PHP templates? Or at least set to xml syntax

Haskell:
  * Experiment with SHIM

Snippets:
  * Snippets and acp -- completing breaks $x references
  * C snippets should NOT be included in cpp ones!
  * Add sql snippets
  * nested snippets (additional check on <tab>?)

Yaml snippets:
	* Camelize, snake_case, etc.

Changes made to plugins:
  * ccimpl.vim -- minor change from vsplit to split
  * FindInNERDTree.vim -- line 44, changed rx matching to stridx() call
  * Markdown syntax -- added txt syntax
  * php indenting script
  * Vorg
  * SHIM -- finish if has('win32')
