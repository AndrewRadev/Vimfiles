Think of something to make application detection easier for Utl.
Think about removing the wildcard -- not used it once.

Dbext:
  * Mappings
  * Window placement
  * Install perl + CPAN stuff

PHP:
  * Hack the ctags php parser.

Haskell:
  * Figure out the problems with documentation searches

Snippets: 
  * nested snippets (additional check on <tab>?)
  * wildcard + additional character?

Yaml snippets:
	* Camelize, snake_case, etc.

Changes made to plugins:
  * snipMate -- might turn out not so useful after all
  * php indenting script
