Think of something to make application detection easier for Utl.
Group contents of "plugin" by folders wherever possible.

Experimenting with textobjects:
  * try to generalize the function matchers

Plugins:
  * ku
  * skeleton (remove default behaviour?)
  * submode ... "Space-*" mode? <Space>-mru,file,window?,g+-?,tags?

Dbext:
  * Mappings
  * Window placement
  * Install perl + CPAN stuff

PHP:
  * Hack the ctags php parser.

Haskell:
  * Figure out the problems with documentation searches

Snippets: 
  * nested snippets (additional check on <tab>?)
  * wildcard + additional character?

Yaml snippets:
	* Camelize, snake_case, etc.



Changes made to plugins:
  * php indenting script
