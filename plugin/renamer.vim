" renamer.vim 
" Maintainer:	John Orr (john undersc0re orr yah00 c0m)
" Version:	    1.1
" Last Change:	09 February 2010

" Introduction: {{{1
" Basic Usage:
" Show a list of file names in a directory, rename then in the vim 
" buffer using vim editing commands, then have vim rename them on disk

" Description: 
" Renaming a single file is easily done via an operating system file explorer,
" the vim file explorer (netrw.vim), or the command line.  When you want to
" rename a bunch of files, especially when you want to do a common text
" manipulation to those file names, this plugin may help.  It shows you all
" the files in the current directory, and lets you edit their names in the vim
" buffer.  When you're ready, issue the command ":Ren" to perform the mass
" rename.  The intention is to rename files in the same directory, but
" relative paths can be specified to move files around - provided the 
" destination directories exist.

" Install Details:
" The usual - drop this file into your $HOME/.vim/plugin directory (unix)
" or $HOME/vimfiles/plugin directory (Windows), etc.
" Use the commands defined below to invoke the functionality (or redefine them
" elsewhere to what you want), and set the User Configurable Variables as
" desired.

" Installing As Windows XP Right Click Menu Option:
" To add running this script on a directory as a right click menu option,
" in Windows XP, if you are confident working with the registry, do as
" follows (NOTE - THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAME FROM THE WEB AND WORKED FOR
" ME, BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE THEY ARE 100% SAFE):
" - Run the Registry Editor (REGEDIT.EXE). 
" - Open My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory and click on the 
"   sub-item 'shell'. 
" - Select New from the Edit menu, and then select Key. 
" - Here, type VimRenamer and press Enter. 
" - Double-click on the (default) value in the right pane, and type the name
"   to see in the meny, eg Rename Files with Vim Renamer, and press Enter.
" - Highlight the new key in the left pane, select New from the Edit menu, 
"   and then select Key again. 
" - Type the word Command for the name of this new key, and press Enter. 
" - Double-click on the (default) value in the right pane, and type the full 
"   path and filename to vim, along with the command as per the following 
"   example line:
"   "C:\Program Files\vim\vim70\gvim.exe" -c "cd %1|Renamer"
"   Change the path as required, press Enter when done.
" - Close the Registry Editor when finished.

" Possible Improvements:
" - Create required directories if relative directories don't exist.  Issues -
"   should we seek confirmation in case it was a mistake?  What permissions
"   should we give to the new directory?
" - When starting renamer from an already running instance of vim, the cursor
"   begins in the original files window if that is enabled.  The reason for
"   this related to the fact that I couldn't get the window sizing to work
"   when renamer was invoked directly from the command line unless the cursor
"   stayed in the left window initially.  The way it is suits me, but if you
"   can help fix the problem, let me know.
" - Add different ways of sorting files, eg case insensitive, by date, size etc
" - Rationalise the code so directories and files use the same arrays indexed
"   by type of file.
" - Refactor to make functions smaller
" - 
" - Make a suggestion!
"
" Changelog:   {{{1
" 1.0 - initial functionality
" 1.1 - added options to
"       a) support :w as substitute for :Ren, and
"       b) ignore wildignore settings when reading in files
"     - fixed highlighting after file deletion
"     - various other minor changes, eg naming the buffer.
