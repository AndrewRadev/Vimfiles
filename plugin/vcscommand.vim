" Section: Documentation {{{1
"
" Provides functions to invoke various source control commands on the current
" file (either the current buffer, or, in the case of an directory buffer, the
" directory and all subdirectories associated with the current buffer).  The
" output of the commands is captured in a new scratch window.
"
" This plugin needs additional extension plugins, each  specific to a source
" control system, to function.  Those plugins should be placed in a
" subdirectory of the standard plugin directory named 'vcscommand'.  Several
" options include the name of the version control system in the option name.
" Such options use the placeholder text '{VCSType}', which would be replaced
" in actual usage with 'CVS' or 'SVN', for instance.
"
" Command documentation {{{2
"
" VCSAdd           Adds the current file to source control.
"
" VCSAnnotate[!]   Displays the current file with each line annotated with the
"                  version in which it was most recently changed.  If an
"                  argument is given, the argument is used as a revision
"                  number to display.  If not given an argument, it uses the
"                  most recent version of the file on the current branch.
"                  Additionally, if the current buffer is a VCSAnnotate buffer
"                  already, the version number on the current line is used.
"
"                  If '!' is used, the view of the annotated buffer is split
"                  so that the annotation is in a separate window from the
"                  content, and each is highlighted separately.
"
" VCSBlame         Alias for 'VCSAnnotate'.
"
" VCSCommit[!]     Commits changes to the current file to source control.
"
"                  If called with arguments, the arguments are the log message.
"
"                  If '!' is used, an empty log message is committed.
"
"                  If called with no arguments, this is a two-step command.
"                  The first step opens a buffer to accept a log message.
"                  When that buffer is written, it is automatically closed and
"                  the file is committed using the information from that log
"                  message.  The commit can be abandoned if the log message
"                  buffer is deleted or wiped before being written.
"
" VCSDelete        Deletes the current file and removes it from source control.
"
" VCSDiff          With no arguments, this displays the differences between
"                  the current file and its parent version under source
"                  control in a new scratch buffer.
"
"                  With one argument, the diff is performed on the
"                  current file against the specified revision.
"
"                  With two arguments, the diff is performed between the
"                  specified revisions of the current file.
"
"                  This command uses the 'VCSCommand{VCSType}DiffOpt' variable
"                  to specify diff options.  If that variable does not exist,
"                  a plugin-specific default is used.  If you wish to have no
"                  options, then set it to the empty string.
"
" VCSGotoOriginal  Jumps to the source buffer if the current buffer is a VCS
"                  scratch buffer.  If VCSGotoOriginal[!] is used, remove all
"                  VCS scratch buffers associated with the original file.
"
" VCSInfo          Displays extended information about the current file in a
"                  new scratch buffer. 
"
" VCSLock          Locks the current file in order to prevent other users from
"                  concurrently modifying it.  The exact semantics of this
"                  command depend on the underlying VCS.
"
" VCSLog           Displays the version history of the current file in a new
"                  scratch buffer.
"
" VCSRemove        Alias for 'VCSDelete'.
"
" VCSRevert        Replaces the modified version of the current file with the
"                  most recent version from the repository.
"
" VCSReview        Displays a particular version of the current file in a new
"                  scratch buffer.  If no argument is given, the most recent
"                  version of the file on the current branch is retrieved.
"
" VCSStatus        Displays versioning information about the current file in a
"                  new scratch buffer.
"
" VCSUnlock        Unlocks the current file in order to allow other users from
"                  concurrently modifying it.  The exact semantics of this
"                  command depend on the underlying VCS.
"
" VCSUpdate        Updates the current file with any relevant changes from the
"                  repository.
"
" VCSVimDiff       Uses vimdiff to display differences between versions of the
"                  current file.
"
"                  If no revision is specified, the most recent version of the
"                  file on the current branch is used.  With one argument,
"                  that argument is used as the revision as above.  With two
"                  arguments, the differences between the two revisions is
"                  displayed using vimdiff.
"
"                  With either zero or one argument, the original buffer is
"                  used to perform the vimdiff.  When the scratch buffer is
"                  closed, the original buffer will be returned to normal
"                  mode.
"
"                  Once vimdiff mode is started using the above methods,
"                  additional vimdiff buffers may be added by passing a single
"                  version argument to the command.  There may be up to 4
"                  vimdiff buffers total.
"
"                  Using the 2-argument form of the command resets the vimdiff
"                  to only those 2 versions.  Additionally, invoking the
"                  command on a different file will close the previous vimdiff
"                  buffers.
"
" Mapping documentation: {{{2
"
" By default, a mapping is defined for each command.  User-provided mappings
" can be used instead by mapping to <Plug>CommandName, for instance:
"
" nmap ,ca <Plug>VCSAdd
"
" The default mappings are as follow:
"
"   <Leader>ca VCSAdd
"   <Leader>cn VCSAnnotate
"   <Leader>cN VCSAnnotate!
"   <Leader>cc VCSCommit
"   <Leader>cD VCSDelete
"   <Leader>cd VCSDiff
"   <Leader>cg VCSGotoOriginal
"   <Leader>cG VCSGotoOriginal!
"   <Leader>ci VCSInfo
"   <Leader>cl VCSLog
"   <Leader>cL VCSLock
"   <Leader>cr VCSReview
"   <Leader>cs VCSStatus
"   <Leader>cu VCSUpdate
"   <Leader>cU VCSUnlock
"   <Leader>cv VCSVimDiff
"
" Options documentation: {{{2
"
" Several variables are checked by the script to determine behavior as follow:
"
" VCSCommandCommitOnWrite
"   This variable, if set to a non-zero value, causes the pending commit to
"   take place immediately as soon as the log message buffer is written.  If
"   set to zero, only the VCSCommit mapping will cause the pending commit to
"   occur.  If not set, it defaults to 1.
"
" VCSCommandDeleteOnHide
"   This variable, if set to a non-zero value, causes the temporary VCS result
"   buffers to automatically delete themselves when hidden.
"
" VCSCommand{VCSType}DiffOpt
"   This variable, if set, determines the options passed to the diff command
"   of the underlying VCS.  Each VCS plugin defines a default value.
"
" VCSCommandDiffSplit
"   This variable overrides the VCSCommandSplit variable, but only for buffers
"   created with VCSVimDiff.
"
" VCSCommandDisableAll
"   This variable, if set, prevents the plugin or any extensions from loading
"   at all.  This is useful when a single runtime distribution is used on
"   multiple systems with varying versions.
"
" VCSCommandDisableMappings
"   This variable, if set to a non-zero value, prevents the default command
"   mappings from being set.
"
" VCSCommandDisableExtensionMappings
"   This variable, if set to a non-zero value, prevents the default command
"   mappings from being set for commands specific to an individual VCS.
"
" VCSCommandEdit
"   This variable controls whether to split the current window to display a
"   scratch buffer ('split'), or to display it in the current buffer ('edit').
"   If not set, it defaults to 'split'.
"
" VCSCommandEnableBufferSetup
"   This variable, if set to a non-zero value, activates VCS buffer management
"   mode.  This mode means that the buffer variable 'VCSRevision' is set if
"   the file is VCS-controlled.  This is useful for displaying version
"   information in the status bar.  Additional options may be set by
"   individual VCS plugins.
"
" VCSCommandMappings
"   This variable, if set, overrides the default mappings used for shortcuts.
"   It should be a List of 2-element Lists, each containing a shortcut and
"   function name pair.
"
" VCSCommandMapPrefix
"   This variable, if set, overrides the default mapping prefix ('<Leader>c').
"   This allows customization of the mapping space used by the vcscommand
"   shortcuts.
"
" VCSCommandResultBufferNameExtension
"   This variable, if set to a non-blank value, is appended to the name of the
"   VCS command output buffers.  For example, '.vcs'.  Using this option may
"   help avoid problems caused by autocommands dependent on file extension.
"
" VCSCommandResultBufferNameFunction
"   This variable, if set, specifies a custom function for naming VCS command
"   output buffers.  This function will be passed the following arguments:
"
"   command - name of the VCS command being executed (such as 'Log' or
"   'Diff').
"
"   originalBuffer - buffer number of the source file.
"
"   vcsType - type of VCS controlling this file (such as 'CVS' or 'SVN').
"
"   statusText - extra text associated with the VCS action (such as version
"   numbers).
"
" VCSCommandSplit
"   This variable controls the orientation of the various window splits that
"   may occur (such as with VCSVimDiff, when using a VCS command on a VCS
"   command buffer, or when the 'VCSCommandEdit' variable is set to 'split'.
"   If set to 'horizontal', the resulting windows will be on stacked on top of
"   one another.  If set to 'vertical', the resulting windows will be
"   side-by-side.  If not set, it defaults to 'horizontal' for all but
"   VCSVimDiff windows.
"
" VCSCommandVCSTypeOverride
"   This variable allows the VCS type detection to be overridden on a
"   path-by-path basis.  The value of this variable is expected to be a List
"   of Lists.  Each high-level List item is a List containing two elements.
"   The first element is a regular expression that will be matched against the
"   full file name of a given buffer.  If it matches, the second element will
"   be used as the VCS type.
"
" Event documentation {{{2
"   For additional customization, VCSCommand.vim uses User event autocommand
"   hooks.  Each event is in the VCSCommand group, and different patterns
"   match the various hooks.
"
"   For instance, the following could be added to the vimrc to provide a 'q'
"   mapping to quit a VCS scratch buffer:
"
"   augroup VCSCommand
"     au VCSCommand User VCSBufferCreated silent! nmap <unique> <buffer> q :bwipeout<cr> 
"   augroup END
"
"   The following hooks are available:
"
"   VCSBufferCreated           This event is fired just after a VCS command
"                              output buffer is created.  It is executed
"                              within the context of the new buffer.
"
"   VCSBufferSetup             This event is fired just after VCS buffer setup
"                              occurs, if enabled.
"
"   VCSPluginInit              This event is fired when the VCSCommand plugin
"                              first loads.
"
"   VCSPluginFinish            This event is fired just after the VCSCommand
"                              plugin loads.
"
"   VCSVimDiffFinish           This event is fired just after the VCSVimDiff
"                              command executes to allow customization of,
"                              for instance, window placement and focus.
