## Important gotcha

To use snipMate properly, it's highly suggested that you grep all of your
plugin directories for `vmap` and `vnoremap` and replace them with `xmap` and
`xnoremap`, respectively.

Another option, which seems much more robust is to execute `smapclear` after
all plugins have been loaded -- I do that in "after/plugin/smapclear.vim"

To find out the reason, just `:help Select-mode-mapping`

## Notes

Anything that starts with "personal", like "personal_table", "personal_rspec",
etc., consists of my own attempts to write some useful script or plugin.
