## Important gotcha

To use snipMate properly, it's highly suggested that you grep your entire
plugin dir for `vmap` and `vnoremap` and replace them with `xmap` and
`xnoremap`, respectively. To find out the reason, just `:help
Select-mode-mapping`

## Notes

Anything that starts with "custom", like "custom_table", "custom_rspec", etc.,
consists of my own attempts to write some useful script or plugin. So far, I've
got nothing complete whatsoever.
