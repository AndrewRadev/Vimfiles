## Usage:

  This applies to all permutations listed below (except multi).

- Create a private gist.

        :Gist -p

- Create a public gist.
  (Only relevant if you've set gists to be private by default.)

>  This is only relevant if you've set gists to be private by default;
> if you get an empty gist list, try ":Gist --abandon".

- Create a gist anonymously.

        :Gist -a

- Create a gist with all open buffers.

        :Gist -m

  You can update the gist with the ":w" command within the gist buffer.

  first).

        :Gist -e foo.js

  first). >

        :Gist -c XXXXX

        :Gist -l

        :Gist -l mattn

- List everyone's gists.

        :Gist -la

## Tips:

If you set g:gist_clip_command, gist.vim will copy the gist code with option
'-c'.

- Mac:

        let g:gist_clip_command = 'pbcopy'

- Linux:

        let g:gist_clip_command = 'xclip -selection clipboard'

- Others (cygwin?):

        let g:gist_clip_command = 'putclip'

If you want to detect filetype from the filename:

    let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1

If you want to open browser after the post:

    let g:gist_open_browser_after_post = 1

If you want to change the browser:

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'w3m %URL%'

or:

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'opera %URL% &'

On windows, this should work with your user settings.

If you want to show your private gists with ":Gist -l":

    let g:gist_show_privates = 1

If you want your gist to be private by default:

    let g:gist_post_private = 1

You need to either set global git config

	$ git config --global github.user Username

## Requirements:

- curl command (http://curl.haxx.se/)
- webapi-vim (https://github.com/mattn/webapi-vim)
- and if you want to use your git profile, the git command-line client.
