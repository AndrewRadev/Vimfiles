1. Overview                                           *languagetool-overview*

This plugin integrates LanguageTool into Vim. LanguageTool is an Open Source
style and grammar checker for English, French, German, etc. See
http://www.languagetool.org/languages/ for a complete list of supported
languages.

LanguageTool detects grammar mistakes that a spelling checker cannot detect
such as "it work" instead of "it works". Since version 1.8, LanguageTool
can also detect spelling mistakes using Hunspell dictionaries bundled with
LanguageTool for several languages or using morfologik for other languages.
Vim builtin spelling checker can also of course be used along with
LanguageTool. One advantage of the spelling checker of LanguageTool over
Vim spelling checker, is that it uses the native Hunspell dictionary directly,
so it works even with the latest Hunspell dictionaries containing features
not supported by Vim. For example, the latest French Hunspell dictionaries
from http://www.dicollect.org are not supported by Vim but they work well
with LanguageTool. On the other hand, the Vim native spelling checker is
faster and better integrated with Vim.

See http://www.languagetool.org/ for more information about LanguageTool.

LanguageTool can be downloaded from:

  http://www.languagetool.org/

============================================================================

4. Installation                                   *languagetool-installation*

4.1 Installing the plugin~

Unzip file LanguageTool.zip plugin from in your personal |vimfiles| directory
(~/.vim under Unix or %HOMEPATH%\vimfiles under Windows): >

  $ mkdir ~/.vim
  $ cd ~/.vim
  $ unzip /path-to/LanguageTool.zip
  $ vim -c 'helptags ~/.vim/doc'

The zip file contains the following files: >

  plugin/LanguageTool.vim
  doc/LanguageTool.vim

You have to enable plugins by adding these two lines in your |.vimrc| file: >

  set nocompatible
  filetype plugin on

4.2 Installing LanguageTool~

To use this plugin, you need to install the Java LanguageTool program. You
can choose to:

* download stand-alone version of LanguageTool (LanguageTool-*.zip) from:
  http://www.languagetool.org/ using the orange button labelled
  "Download LanguageTool for stand-alone use". The standalone version of
  Vim not only does grammar checking but also contains Hunspell dictionaries
  for spell checking.
* or download a nightly build LanguageTool-.*-snapshot.zip from
  http://www.languagetool.org/download/snapshots/. It contains a more
  recent version than the stable version but it is not as well tested.
* or checkout and build the latest LanguageTool from sources in subversion.

4.2.1 Download the stand-alone version of LanguageTool

Download the stand-alone version of LanguageTool (LanguageTool-*.zip)
from http://www.languagetool.org/ and unzip it: >

  $ unzip LanguageTool-2.0.zip

This should extract LanguageTool.jar among several other files.

4.2.2 Build LanguageTool from sources in Subversion~

If you prefer to build LanguageTool yourself from sources, you first need
to install the pre-requisite packages. On Ubuntu, you need to install the
following packages: >

  $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk mvn subversion

Since version 2.1, LanguageTool is built with Maven. Prior to version 2.1,
it was built with ant.

LanguageTool can then be downloaded and built with Maven as follows: >

  $ svn co https://languagetool.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/languagetool/trunk/languagetool
  $ cd languagetool
  $ mvn clean package

After the build, the command line version of LanguageTool can be found in: >

  ./languagetool-standalone/target/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/languagetool-commandline.jar

4.3 Configuring the location of LanguageTool.jar~

After installing LanguageTool, you must specify the location of the file
LanguageTool.jar in your $HOME/.vimrc file. Example: >

  let g:languagetool_jar='$HOME/languagetool/languagetool-standalone/target/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/LanguageTool-2.1-SNAPSHOT/languagetool-commandline.jar'

Prior to LanguageTool-2.1, the command line version of LanguageTool
was called LanguageTool.jar.

See section |languagetool-configuration| for more optional settings.

============================================================================

5. Configuration                                 *languagetool-configuration*

LanguageTool plugin uses character encoding from the 'fenc' option or from
the 'enc' option if 'fenc' is empty.

Several global variables can be set in your |vimrc| to configure the behavior
of the LanguageTool plugin.

g:languagetool_jar                                       *g:languagetool_jar*

  This variable specifies the location of the LanguageTool java grammar
  checker program.
  Default is: $HOME/languagetool/dist/LanguageTool.jar

g:languagetool_lang

  The language code to use for the language tool checker. If undefined,
  plugin tries to guess the language of the Vim spelling checker
  'spelllang' or v:lang. If neither works, plugin defaults to
  English US (en-US). Starting with LanguageTool-1.8, regional variants
  of some languages can be specified. For languages with variants
  (currently English and German), it is necessary to specify the
  variant in order for LanguageTool to signal spelling errors.
  In other words, with  :set spelllang=en  LanguageTool only
  signals grammar mistakes whereas with  :set spellllang=en_us
  LanguageTool signals spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes.
  The valid language codes in LanguageTool-2.1 are: >

    ast    Asturian
    be     Belarusian
    br     Breton
    ca     Catalan

g:languagetool_disable_rules                   *g:languagetool_disable_rules*

  This variable specifies checker rules which are disabled. Each disabled
  rule must be comma separated.
  Default value set by plugin is: WHITESPACE_RULE,EN_QUOTES

g:languagetool_win_height                         *g:languagetool_win_height*

  This variable specifies the height of the scratch window which contains
  all grammatical mistakes with some explanations. You can use a negative
  value to disable opening the scratch window. You can also make it empty ''
  to let Vim pick a default size.
  Default is: 14

You can also customize the following syntax highlighting groups: >

  LanguageToolGrammarError
  LanguageToolSpellingError
  LanguageToolCmd
  LanguageToolLabel
  LanguageToolErrorCount

============================================================================

6. Features                                           *languagetool-features*

The LanguageTool plugin defines 2 commands |:LanguageToolCheck| and
|:LanguageToolClean|.

:LanguageToolCheck                                       *:LanguageToolCheck*

Use the |:LanguageToolCheck| command to check the grammar in the current
buffer. This will highlight errors in the buffer. It will also open a new
scratch window with the list of grammar mistakes with further explanations
for each error. It also populates the location-list for the window.

The |:LanguageToolCheck| command accepts a range. You can for example check
grammar between lines 100 and 200 in buffer with :100,200LanguageToolCheck,
check grammar in the visual selection with :<',>'LanguageToolCheck, etc.
The default range is 1,$ (whole buffer).

:LanguageToolClear                                       *:LanguageToolClear*

Use the |:LanguageToolClear| command to clear highlighting of grammar
mistakes, close the scratch window containing the list of errors, clear
and close the location-list.

The two commands are also available from the menu in gvim: >

  Plugin -> LanguageTool -> Check
                         -> Clear

Using the error scratch window~

Pressing <Enter> on an error in the error scratch buffer will jump to that
error.

Using the Location-list~

The |location-list| is populated when running |:LanguageToolCheck|. So you can
use location-list Vim commands such as |:lopen| to open the location-list
window, |:lne| to jump to the next error, etc.

The error scratch window may seem redundant with the location-list, but the
scratch window is more flexible to present errors in a nice way. If you do
not wish to popup the error scratch window, but use the location-list only,
you can disable it by setting |g:languagetool_win_height| to a negative value.

7. Bugs                                                   *languagetool-bugs*

Column number reported by LanguageTool indicating the location of the error
is sometimes incorrect. There is already an opened ticket about this bug:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3054895&group_id=110216&atid=655717

The script currently works around it by doing pattern matching with
information context but it's not a perfect workaround: it can cause
spurious highlighting of errors in rare cases. This bug is fixed in
LanguageTool-1.8.

Please report bugs or suggestions to <dominique.pelle@gmail.com>.
