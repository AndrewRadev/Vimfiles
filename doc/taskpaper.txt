Introduction
=============

From the TaskPaper website (<http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/taskpaper>):

> "TaskPaper is a simple to-do list application that helps you stay
> organized. Unlike competing applications, TaskPaper is based on plain text
> files which offer you paper-like simplicity and ease of use." 

TaskPaper is a to-do list application for Mac OS X based on the "Getting
Things Done" approach of David Allen (<http://www.davidco.com/>). It supports
the GTD notions of projects, tasks and contexts.

This package contains a syntax file and a file-type plugin for the simple
format used by the TaskPaper application. It is intended for Mac users who
want to edit their TaskPaper lists in Vim from time to time (for example, in
a SSH session, or on a non-Mac system) and for anyone who is looking for a
simple to-do list format.

Installation
=============

It should be safe to simply unpack the package into your .vim directory.
It contains the following files:

    doc/taskpaper.txt
    doc/example.taskpaper
    doc/taskpaper_licence.txt
    ftplugin/taskpaper.vim
    syntax/taskpaper.vim
    ftdetect/taskpaper.vim

To access this help file from within Vim you must first update your help 
tags:

    :helptags ~/.vim/doc

The path may need to be modified depending on where you install to. Once
you have done this you can access the help with this command:

    :help taskpaper

Syntax
=======

The syntax file highlights project headings and task contexts (tags), and
"greys out" completed tasks. The exact style of the displayed file depends
on your Vim colour scheme. 

A project heading is a piece of text ending in a colon.  Projects can be
folded using the "syntax" foldmethod.

A task is a line beginning with a hyphen '-' and can have zero or more
context tags.

A context tag has the form "@tag".

File-type Plugin
=================

The file-type plugin tries to make editing TaskPaper files in Vim more
comfortable. 

Vim can complete context names after the '@' using the keyword completion
commands (e.g. Ctrl-X Ctrl-N).

The plugin defines some new mappings: 

    \td     Mark task as done
    \tc     Show all tasks with context under cursor
    \tp     Fold all projects
    \ta     Show all projects and tasks

Note: if `<LocalLeader>` has been changed (e.g. `:let maplocalleader=",,"`)
then its value should be used instead of `\` in the mappings.

Marking a task as done will add the "@done" context tag to the end of the
task, and it will be greyed out by the syntax file.

To show all tasks with a particular context tag, move the cursor over the
desired context tag (e.g. using movement or search commands) and then use
the `\tc` command. This will fold all the irrelevant tasks leaving only the
tasks in the current context visible.

To fold all projects leaving only the headings visible use the `\tp` command.
Standard fold commands can be used to open (`zo`) and close (`zc`) individual
projects.

To show all projects and tasks use the `\ta` command. This disables folding so
that the entire file is expanded.

File-type Detection
====================

This package also contains a script to automatically use the TaskPaper file
type for all files with the ".taskpaper" extension.

Acknowledgements
=================

The initial version of the ToggleDone() function was based on SwitchBox()
from the VimOutliner Checkboxes script written by Noel Henson (available
from <http://www.vimoutliner.org>).

Context folding expression was based on a snippet from Vim Tip 282
(<http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip.php?tip_id=282>).
