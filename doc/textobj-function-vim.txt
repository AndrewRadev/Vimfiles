==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION				   *textobj-function-vim-introduction*

*textobj-function-vim* is a Vim additional filetype plugin to provide text
objects for functions in Vim script.  This is a support script for
|textobj-function|, so that you have to install it to enable the text objects.
Unless installing, this script does nothing.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-function| 0.1.0 or later (vimscript#2619)

Latest version:
http://github.com/kana/config/commits/vim-textobj-function




==============================================================================
INTERFACE				      *textobj-function-vim-interface*

See |textobj-function| for the details.  Because this plugin just enhances the
power of textobj-function and does not provide any user interface.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*textobj-function-vim-bugs*

- Assumption: |:function| and |:endfunction| must be written solely in their
  own lines, as follows:
>
	function GoodOne()
	  return 'o'
	endfunction
<
  Not as follows:
>
	echo 'x' | function BadOne()
	  return 'x'
	endfunction
<

- See |textobj-function-bugs| for further information.
