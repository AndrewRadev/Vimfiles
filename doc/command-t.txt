INTRODUCTION                                    *command-t*

The Command-T plug-in provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for
opening files with a minimal number of keystrokes. It's named "Command-T"
because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window bound to Command-T in
TextMate.

Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and are
ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in certain
locations (for example, immediately after a path separator) should be given
more weight.

Screencasts demonstrating the plug-in can be viewed at:

REQUIREMENTS                                    *command-t-requirements*

The plug-in requires VIM compiled with Ruby support, a compatible Ruby
installation at the operating system level, and a C compiler to build
the Ruby extension.

1. VIM compiled with Ruby support

You can check for Ruby support by launching VIM with the --version switch:

  vim --version

If "+ruby" appears in the version information then your version of VIM has
Ruby support.

Another way to check is to simply try using the :ruby command from within VIM
itself:

  :ruby 1

If your VIM lacks support you'll see an error message like this:

  E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version

The version of VIM distributed with Mac OS X does not include Ruby support,
while MacVim does; it is available from:

  http://code.google.com/p/macvim/

For Windows users, the executable from www.vim.org does include Ruby support.

2. Ruby

In addition to having Ruby support in VIM, your system itself must have a
compatible Ruby install. In practice this usually means a version of Ruby from
the 1.8 series, as VIM's support for 1.9 is still not official.

The current version of Mac OS X comes with Ruby 1.8.7.

A suitable Ruby environment for Windows can be installed using RubyInstaller
available at:

  http://rubyinstaller.org/download.html

If using RubyInstaller be sure to download the installer executable, not the
7-zip archive. When installing mark the checkbox "Add Ruby executables to your
PATH" so that VIM can find them.

3. C compiler

Part of Command-T is implemented in C as a Ruby extension for speed, allowing
it to work responsively even on directory hierarchies containing enormous
numbers of files. As such, a C compiler is required in order to build the
extension and complete the installation.

On Mac OS X, this can be obtained by installing the Xcode Tools that come on
the Mac OS X install disc.

On Windows, the RubyInstaller Development Kit can be used to conveniently
install the necessary tool chain:

  http://wiki.github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/development-kit

To use the Development Kit extract the archive contents to your C:\Ruby
folder.


INSTALLATION                                    *command-t-installation*

Command-T is distributed as a "vimball" which means that it can be installed
by opening it in VIM and then sourcing it:

  :e command-t.vba
  :so %

The files will be installed in your |'runtimepath'|. To check where this is
you can issue:

  :echo &rtp

The C extension must then be built, which can be done from the shell. If you
use a typical |'runtimepath'| then the files were installed inside ~/.vim and
you can build the extension with:

  cd ~/.vim/ruby/command-t
  ruby extconf.rb
  make


TROUBLE-SHOOTING                                *command-t-trouble-shooting*

Most installation problems are caused by a mismatch between the version of
Ruby on the host operating system, and the version of Ruby that VIM itself
linked against at compile time. For example, if one is 32-bit and the other is
64-bit, or one is from the Ruby 1.9 series and the other is from the 1.8
series, then the plug-in is not likely to work.

As such, on Mac OS X, I recommend using the standard Ruby that comes with the
system (currently 1.8.7) along with the latest snapshot of MacVim (currently
snapshot 52).

On Windows, I recommend using the version 1.8.7 RubyInstaller and the
corresponding RubyInstaller Development Kit linked to above, along with the
standard (32-bit) version of VIM that can be downloaded from www.vim.org.


USAGE                                           *command-t-usage*

Bring up the Command-T match window by typing:

  <Leader>t

If a mapping for <Leader>t already exists at the time the plug-in is loaded
then Command-T will not overwrite it. You can instead open the match window by
issuing the command:

  :CommandT

A prompt will appear at the bottom of the screen along with a match window
showing all of the files in the current directory (as returned by the
|:pwd| command).

Type letters in the prompt to narrow down the selection, showing only the
files whose paths contain those letters in the specified order. Letters do not
need to appear consecutively in a path in order for it to be classified as a
match.

Once the desired file has been selected it can be opened by pressing <CR>.
(By default files are opened in the current window, but there are other
mappings that you can use to open in a vertical or horizontal split, or in
a new tab.) Note that if you have |'nohidden'| set and there are unsaved
changes in the current window when you press <CR> then opening in the current
window would fail; in this case Command-T will open the file in a new split.

The following mappings are active when the prompt has focus:

    <BS>        delete the character to the left of the cursor
    <Del>       delete the character at the cursor
    <Left>      move the cursor one character to the left
    <C-h>       move the cursor one character to the left
    <Right>     move the cursor one character to the right
    <C-l>       move the cursor one character to the right
    <C-a>       move the cursor to the start (left)
    <C-e>       move the cursor to the end (right)
    <C-u>       clear the contents of the prompt
    <Tab>       change focus to the match listing

The following mappings are active when the match listing has focus:

    <Tab>       change focus to the prompt

The following mappings are active when either the prompt or the match listing
has focus:

    <CR>        open the selected file
    <C-CR>      open the selected file in a new split window
    <C-s>       open the selected file in a new split window
    <C-v>       open the selected file in a new vertical split window
    <C-t>       open the selected file in a new tab
    <C-j>       select next file in the match listing
    <C-n>       select next file in the match listing
    <Down>      select next file in the match listing
    <C-k>       select previous file in the match listing
    <C-p>       select previous file in the match listing
    <Up>        select previous file in the match listing
    <C-c>       cancel (dismisses match listing)

The following is also available on terminals which support it:

    <Esc>       cancel (dismisses match listing)

Note that the default mappings can be overriden by setting options in your
~/.vimrc file (see the OPTIONS section for a full list of available options).

In addition, when the match listing has focus, typing a character will cause
the selection to jump to the first path which begins with that character.
Typing multiple characters consecutively can be used to distinguish between
paths which begin with the same prefix.


COMMANDS                                        *command-t-commands*

                                                *:CommandT*
|:CommandT|     Brings up the Command-T match window, starting in the
                current working directory as returned by the|:pwd|
                command.

                                                *:CommandTFlush*
|:CommandTFlush|Instructs the plug-in to flush its path cache, causing
                the directory to be rescanned for new or deleted paths
                the next time the match window is shown. In addition, all
                configuration settings are re-evaluated, causing any
                changes made to settings via the |:let| command to be picked
                up.


MAPPINGS                                        *command-t-mappings*

By default Command-T comes with only one mapping:

  <Leader>t     bring up the Command-T match window

However, Command-T won't overwrite a pre-existing mapping so if you prefer
to define a different mapping use a line like this in your ~/.vimrc:

  nmap <silent> <Leader>t :CommandT<CR>

Replacing "<Leader>t" with your mapping of choice.

Note that in the case of MacVim you actually can map to Command-T (written
as <D-t> in VIM) in your ~/.gvimrc file if you first unmap the existing menu
binding of Command-T to "New Tab":

  if has("gui_macvim")
    macmenu &File.New\ Tab key=<nop>
    map <D-t> :CommandT<CR>
  endif

When the Command-T window is active a number of other additional mappings
become available for doing things like moving between and selecting matches.
These are fully described above in the USAGE section, and settings for
overriding the mappings are listed below under OPTIONS.


OPTIONS                                         *command-t-options*

A number of options may be set in your ~/.vimrc to influence the behaviour of
the plug-in. To set an option, you include a line like this in your ~/.vimrc:

    let g:CommandTMaxFiles=20000

To have Command-T pick up new settings immediately (that is, without having
to restart VIM) you can issue the |:CommandTFlush| command after making
changes via |:let|.

Following is a list of all available options:

                                                *g:CommandTMaxFiles*
  |g:CommandTMaxFiles|                           number (default 10000)

      The maximum number of files that will be considered when scanning the
      current directory. Upon reaching this number scanning stops.

                                                *g:CommandTMaxDepth*
  |g:CommandTMaxDepth|                           number (default 15)

      The maximum depth (levels of recursion) to be explored when scanning the
      current directory. Any directories at levels beyond this depth will be
      skipped.

                                                *g:CommandTMaxHeight*
  |g:CommandTMaxHeight|                          number (default: 0)

      The maximum height in lines the match window is allowed to expand to.
      If set to 0, the window will occupy as much of the available space as
      needed to show matching entries.

                                                *g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles*
  |g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles|                 boolean (default: 0)

      By default Command-T will show dot-files only if the entered search
      string contains a dot that could cause a dot-file to match. When set to
      a non-zero value, this setting instructs Command-T to always include
      matching dot-files in the match list regardless of whether the search
      string contains a dot. See also |g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles|.

                                                *g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles*
  |g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles|                  boolean (default: 0)

      By default Command-T will show dot-files if the entered search string
      contains a dot that could cause a dot-file to match. When set to a
      non-zero value, this setting instructs Command-T to never show dot-files
      under any circumstances. Note that it is contradictory to set both this
      setting and |g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles| to true, and if you do so VIM
      will suffer from headaches, nervous twitches, and sudden mood swings.

                                                *g:CommandTScanDotDirectories*
  |g:CommandTScanDotDirectories|                 boolean (default: 0)

      Normally Command-T will not recurse into "dot-directories" (directories
      whose names begin with a dot) while performing its initial scan. Set
      this setting to a non-zero value to override this behavior and recurse.
      Note that this setting is completely independent of the
      |g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles| and |g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles|
      settings; those apply only to the selection and display of matches
      (after scanning has been performed), whereas
      |g:CommandTScanDotDirectories| affects the behaviour at scan-time.

      Note also that even with this setting on you can still use Command-T to
      open files inside a "dot-directory" such as ~/.vim, but you have to use
      the |:cd| command to change into that directory first. For example:

        :cd ~/.vim
        :CommandT

                                                *g:CommandTMatchWindowAtTop*
  |g:CommandTMatchWindowAtTop|                   boolean (default: 0)

      When this settings is off (the default) the match window will appear at
      the bottom so as to keep it near to the prompt. Turning it on causes the
      match window to appear at the top instead. This may be preferable if you
      want the best match (usually the first one) to appear in a fixed location
      on the screen rather than moving as the number of matches changes during
      typing.

As well as the basic options listed above, there are a number of settings that
can be used to override the default key mappings used by Command-T. For
example, to set <C-x> as the mapping for cancelling (dismissing) the Command-T
window, you would add the following to your ~/.vimrc:

  let g:CommandTCancelMap='<C-x>'

Following is a list of all map settings:

                              Setting   Default mapping(s)

                                       *g:CommandTBackspaceMap*
              |g:CommandTBackspaceMap|  <BS>
      Delete the character at the current cursor position

                                       *g:CommandTDeleteMap*
                 |g:CommandTDeleteMap|  <Del>
                 Delete the character to the right of the current cursor position

                                       *g:CommandTAcceptSelectionMap*

                                        <C-s>
                                        Accept the currently selected item
                                        (opens in split window)

                                       *g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabMap*
     |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabMap|  <C-t>
     Accept the currently selected item (opens in tab)

                                       *g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVSplitMap*
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVSplitMap|  <C-v>
Accept the currently selected item (opens in vertical split)

                                       *g:CommandTToggleFocusMap*
            |g:CommandTToggleFocusMap|  <Tab>
Toggle keyboard focus between prompt and match listing

                                       *g:CommandTCancelMap*
                 |g:CommandTCancelMap|  <C-c>
                                        <Esc> (not on all terminals)
Dismiss the Command-T prompt and match listing

                                       *g:CommandTSelectNextMap*
             |g:CommandTSelectNextMap|  <C-n>
                                        <C-j>
                                        <Down>
Select next match in match listing


                                       *g:CommandTSelectPrevMap*
             |g:CommandTSelectPrevMap|  <C-p>
                                        <C-k>
                                        <Up>
Select previous match in match listing


                                       *g:CommandTClearMap*
                  |g:CommandTClearMap|  <C-u>
Clear all text from the prompt


                                       *g:CommandTCursorLeftMap*
             |g:CommandTCursorLeftMap|  <Left>
                                        <C-h>
Move the cursor one character to the left within the prompt


                                       *g:CommandTCursorRightMap*
            |g:CommandTCursorRightMap|  <Right>
                                        <C-l>
Move the cursor one character to the right within the prompt

                                       *g:CommandTCursorEndMap*
              |g:CommandTCursorEndMap|  <C-e>
Move the cursor to the end (far right) of the prompt


                                       *g:CommandTCursorStartMap*
            |g:CommandTCursorStartMap|  <C-a>

In addition to the options provided by Command-T itself, some of VIM's own
settings can be used to control behavior:

                                                *command-t-wildignore*
  |'wildignore'|                                 string (default: '')

      VIM's |'wildignore'| setting is used to determine which files should be
      excluded from listings. This is a comma-separated list of file glob
      patterns. It defaults to the empty string, but common settings include
      "*.o,*.obj" (to exclude object files) or ".git,.svn" (to exclude SCM
      metadata directories). For example:

        :set wildignore+=*.o,*.obj,.git

      See the |'wildignore'| documentation for more information.


AUTHOR                                          *command-t-author*

Command-T is written and maintained by Wincent Colaiuta <win@wincent.com>.

As this was the first VIM plug-in I had ever written I was heavily influenced
by the design of the LustyExplorer plug-in by Stephen Bach, which I understand
is one of the largest Ruby-based VIM plug-ins to date.

While the Command-T codebase doesn't contain any code directly copied from
LustyExplorer, I did use it as a reference for answers to basic questions (like
"How do you do 'X' in a Ruby-based VIM plug-in?"), and also copied some basic
architectural decisions (like the division of the code into Prompt, Settings
and MatchWindow classes).

LustyExplorer is available from:
