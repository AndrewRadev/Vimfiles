Please, be aware that this is a highly young experimental project that I write
in my free time. I might reconsider some concepts, I might change the notation
and many things might change. You must be prepared to notice some glitches
until this goes more stable. I suppose future updates might not be compatible
until I feel I got it right. See|agtd-todo| for things that I still have
planned


==============================================================================
1. Intro                                                *agtd-intro*

Tired of trying thousand of tools to organize my life, and inspired in the
idea of ONE BIG TEXT FILE from Danny O'Brien, I decided that the world needed
yet another GTD tool. The "Almighty" part is a reference to the idea of having
all type of notes about your tasks in one single file.

The whole idea of this GTD implementation relies in some custom notation
marks, the|Folding|capabilities of VIM and its power to work quickly with
text. I wanted something portable to collect, edit, search and structure
lightning fast my notes. This is the result so far:

    * Organize project tree with notes, links and tasks
    * Move tasks from the project tree to the TODO list inserting project label
    * Neatly collect and display all tasks related with a project
    * Ease project tasks/notes finding
    * Build a calendar with all the dates in the text file

I strongly recommend the UTL script as a side companion. It will enhance your
notes allowing you to open different links with just a short keystroke.

This script is my idea of how GTD should be done with VIM. Any comments, bug
reports, patches, fixes and suggestions are welcome.

If you like it, please, rate it in the Vim website to let me know that out
there there are people who find this useful. Otherwise I will consider this
just an scrapbook to learn Vim scripting.

2. Getting started                                      *agtd-getStarted*

You should have some knowledge of GTD in order to make the best use of this
script, but it is not a must.

If you follow a simple notation and some basic structure pattern, AGTD will
provide you with some handy tools to organize your tasks along a nice syntax
highlight. I like my notes to be Christmas tree like, so be warned!

Along this script you should have an example file named "sample-todo.txt".
It might help to play with it while reading its comments.

You must define your own main sections for your notes. Nothing is really
mandatory, but this is how mine usually looks like.

# NOW
# LATER

For this most of the content should be simple tasks lines with context,
project and date marks for the current days (NOW) or rest of the week (LATER)

    @net p:finances:phone Check internet trial charges S::02-12

The parts

    @word       The context of a task (work, net, city, phone...)
    p:sub:path  A project reference label in a task
    X::02-25    A date mark. The "X" represent one single uppercase letter to
                add some information about the date. I usually use 'S' for
                start, 'F' for finish and 'W' for the latest date I should
                wait for something 
    <tab>       Any internal indentation bellow a task to add extra notes or
                explanations will be folded.

# PROJECTS

I usually use the PROJECTS section to organize all my projects and type all
steps I need to take. Here I specify the projects names in uppercase, some
comment lines and UTL links to related stuff.

    TITLE       A (sub)project title (4 spaces indentation)
    ;           Comment
    <url:...>   Any link: web site, file, calendar, server...
    m::<char>   Auto-marks. Set a jump mark that you can use as -> '<char>

Since the contents are structured according the project, I don't type the
project label here. When I decide it is time to work on it I use the
command ":GInsert" to move it to my current list of stuff to do. The function
will also insert a project label based on the line position within the tree.

# LISTS

This is just a bunch of lists that I need to review, as shopping, program
checks, books to read...

# CALENDAR

All those day events that do not fit within any specific task

Once you start exploring the example file, you can play with some basic
functions:

:GSearch    Search for a project (auto-completes with existing projects!)
:GCalendar  Display a sorted list of events (tasks + calendar section)
:GInsert    Insert and label line from PROJECTS section
:GGo        Go to the project tree branch where the task was taken
