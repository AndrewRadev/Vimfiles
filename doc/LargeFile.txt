1. Large File Plugin						*largefile* {{{1

The LargeFile plugin is fairly short -- it simply sets up an |autocmd| that
checks for large files.  There is one parameter: >
	g:LargeFile
which, by default, is 20MB.  Thus with this value of g:LargeFile, 20MByte
files and larger are considered to be "large files"; smaller ones aren't.  Of
course, you as a user may set g:LargeFile to whatever you want in your
<.vimrc> (in units of MBytes).

LargeFile.vim always assumes that when the file size is larger than what
can fit into a signed integer (2^31, ie. about 2GB) that the file is "Large".

Basically, this autocmd simply turns off a number of features in Vim,
including event handling, undo, and syntax highlighting, in the interest of
speed and responsiveness.

LargeFile.vim borrows from vimtip#611.

To undo what LargeFile does, type >
	:Unlarge
<
To redo what LargeFile does, type >
	:Large
<
Note that LargeFile cannot alleviate hardware limitations; vim on 32-bit
machines are limited to editing 2G files.  If your vim is compiled on a 64-bit
machine such that it can take advantage of the additional address space, then
presumably vim could edit up to 9.7 quadrillion byte files (not that I've ever
tried that!).

  4 : Jan 03, 2008 * made LargeFile.vim :AutoInstall:-able by getscript
      Apr 11, 2008 * (Daniel Shahaf suggested) that :Large! do the large-file
                     handling irregardless of file size.  Implemented.
      Sep 23, 2008 * if getfsize() returns -2 then the file is assumed to be
		     large
  3 : May 24, 2007 * Unlarge command included
                   * If getfsize() returns something less than -1, then it
