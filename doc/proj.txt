            For Vim version 7.x
	        Depends on NERDTree

I'd like to believe that using this plugin is fairly straightforward. First,
create a file at ~/.vimproj. If you'd like to use a different location, add
the following to your .vimrc (or wherever you configure Vim):

	let g:ProjFile = '/path/to/your/project.file'

This file uses a regular INI format and doesn't support comments. Here is a
sample .vimproj file:

	[review]
	path = /var/www/rails_apps/review_app
	vim = /home/thomas/.vim-review

	[wordpress]
	path = /var/www/apache2/wordpress

	[vim]
	path = /home/thomas/.vim

	[proj]
	path = /home/thomas/.vim/plugin

    [path-with-spaces]
    path = /home/thomas/Some\ Folder

Right now, Proj only supports two options: "path" and "vim". "path" is the
project's root directory. "vim" is the location of a file with some
modifications specific to the project. The configuration from the "vim" file
is not erased when another project is loaded, so use with care if you're doing
anything fancy.

To select a project, use the "Proj" command. To open the "review" project in
the sample .vimproj file:

	:Proj review

Project names tab-complete. Oh, and if you use a file browser other than 
NERDTree, it should work with Proj. To specify one, add this to your .vimrc:

	let g:ProjFileBrowser = 'filebrowser-command'

This command can be pretty much anything, as it's just passed to "exec".
