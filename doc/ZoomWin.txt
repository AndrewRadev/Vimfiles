==============================================================================
1. Usage						*zoomwin-usage*

   :call ZoomWin()
   :ZoomWin
   <c-w>o

   Either of the two commands or the normal mode <c-w>o will toggle between
	* selecting the current window for display as the only window or
	* to restore the original multiple-window view.

==============================================================================
2. Setup						*zoomwin-setup*

   Simply put ZoomWin.vim into your .vim/plugin directory (you may need to
   make such a directory first).  Under Windows that should be
   vimfiles\plugin.  ZoomWin now uses the HelpExtractor method to
   automatically extract help and to make it known to vim by running helptags
   on it.

3. History						*zoomwin-history*

	v23 Apr 24, 2008 : * when |'scrollbind'| was activated: when ZoomWin
			     attempted to restore multiple-windows, the cursor
			     position was incorrect.  Fixed.
	    Jan 02, 2009   * included some more things in the session file
	                   * broke ZoomWin into an plugin + autoload pair
			   * (Ingo Karkat) contributed a patch to retain the
			     the search pattern before zooming
			   * (Ingo Karkat) contributed a patch to detect the
			     vim 7.2 name for the command line window
	v22 Apr 10, 2006 : * "only" was occasionally issuing an "Already one
	                     window" message, which is now prevented
			   * SavePosn() issued error message when handling an
			     empty buffer
			   * saves yank registers and restores them on each
			     zoom/unzoom
	v21 Oct 12, 2004 : * v14 fixed a bug when wmw and/or wmv equal to 0;
			     v21 will invoke the patch only if the version <= 603.
			     For vim version 6.3 users, this fix allows more files
			     to be handled by ZoomWin.
	    May 10, 2005   * When :version shows -mksession, and the vim version
			     is at least 6.3, ZoomWin will now do a partial zoom
	v20 Jul 26, 2004 : * bugfix - ZoomWin didn't always retain the
			     position in the former zoomed-in window after
			     the window layout was restored.  It was restoring
			     the position when the zoom-in occurred.
	v19 May 26, 2004 : * bugfix - winmanager has events firing that,
	                     amongst other things, reset the bufhidden
			     option to delete for some windows while
			     ZoomWin worked.  ZoomWin now works
			     successfully with winmanager.
	v18 May 20, 2004 : * bugfix - didn't adversely affect anything, but
	                     ZoomWin was deleting its session file twice.
			   * bugfix -- a multi-source file + minibufexplorer
			     + Taglist interaction bug -- minibufexplorer's
			     autocmd events were firing, generating a new
			     window while ZoomWin was attempting to restore
			     the display.  ZoomWin didn't have restoration
			     information for the new window and so reported
			     an error.  Events are now temporarily disabled
			     while ZoomWin is restoring the layout.
	v17 Mar 26, 2004 : * ZoomWin command installed.  Works nicely with
	                     taglist:  vim +Tlist +ZoomWin filename
	v16 Dec 22, 2003 : * handles bufhidden and nobl windows (TagList support).
	                   * Now also works with quickfix window (:copen) but
			     still not with |cmdline-window| (q:)
	v15 Dec 19, 2003 : * SavePosn()/RestorePosn() needed to be preceded
	                     by s: to prevent clashes
	v14 Dec 18, 2003 : * works around a restoration-bug with mksession
			     when either wmw or wmh settings are zero
			   * Bwipes internal temporary buffers
			   * Known bugs: will not work with command-line
			   * Editing window (|cmdline-window|) nor the
			     quickfix window (|copen|).
	v13 Dec 18, 2003 : Uses eventignore to prevent events/autocmds from
			    firing while changing the mksession results.
	v12 Dec 12, 2003 : uses hidden and a minimalist mksession save
	v11 Oct 14, 2003 : bug fix: apparently RestorePosn()'s variables,
			    which were b:, weren't always defined, so s:
			    ones are now used.
	v10 Sep 22, 2003 : Bug fix: when a single window is showing, the user
			    moves the cursor, then <c-w>o used to restore
			    screen, the current cursor position wasn't retained
			   Restores v:this_session.
			   Bug fix: change a window, use <c-w>o, then write.
			   Was saving file only to temporary file instead of
			    actual file, but when the actual file was brought back,
			    the changes were lost.
	v9 Aug 15, 2003 :  v8 managed to trash syntax highlighting on
			   reload, this one removes the eventignore
			   handling.  Will need more pondering...
	v8 Aug 14, 2003 :  now handles not-modified but not filereadable
			   buffers, nowrite buffers uses eventignore to
			   bypass autocmd firing
	v7 May 23, 2003 :  bugfix - GotoWinNum() didn't always get the
			   cursor into the correct window
	v6 Mar 25, 2003 :  more cleanup included
	v5 Mar 14, 2003 :  includes support for handling scratch buffers,
			   no-name buffer windows, and modified-buffer
			   windows.  All windows' contents will be saved to
			   temporary buffers
	v4 Dec 12, 2002 :  Zak Beck contributed code to clean up temporary
			   session files if one leaves vim while zoomed-in
	v3 Dec 11, 2002 :  plugin-ized
	v2 Nov 08, 2002 :  A guaranteed-to-be-unique to this
			   session file is used for session information.
			   Modified but not yet saved files are made hidden
			   during zoom in.
