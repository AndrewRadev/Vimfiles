==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*textobj-function-introduction*

*textobj-function* is a Vim plugin to provide universal text objects for
various kinds of functions.  For example, you can select any function with
|<Plug>(textobj-function-a)| / |<Plug>(textobj-function-i)| (default key
bindings: af / if).

The definition of a "function" is usually differed depending on what you are
editing, so at first, you have to tell the definition of what kind of function
you want to select to textobj-function.  By default, textobj-function knows
about functions in the following languages:
					    *textobj-function-known-languages*
- C language		|textobj-function-c|
- Vim script		|textobj-function-vim|

If you want to tell about more functions in other languages, see
|textobj-function-customizing| for how to tell and
after/ftplugin/*/textobj-function.vim for the samples.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.7 or later (vimscript#2100)

INTERFACE					*textobj-function-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS				       *textobj-function-key-mappings*

In visual mode and operator-pending mode, the following text objects are
available.  Note that the fllowing key mappings will not be defined when its
{lhs} is already mapped.


<Plug>(textobj-function-a)			*<Plug>(textobj-function-a)*
			"a function" - Select the all range of a function.
			This text object is |linewise| by default, but it may
			be |characterwise| or |blockwise| depending on what
			function is being selected.

			Note that unlike built-in text objects, "a function"
			doesn't include leading or trailing blanks and/or
			blank lines.  This problem will be fixed in the near
			future - by adding another text object.

<Plug>(textobj-function-i)			*<Plug>(textobj-function-i)*
			"inner function" - Like |<Plug>(textobj-function-a)|,
			but select the body of a function, other parts of
			a function are not included e.g. its name, its
			arguments and so forth).




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*textobj-function-customizing*

				  *g:textobj_function_no_default_key_mappings*
					  *:TextobjFunctionDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin will define the following key mappings in Visual mode and
Operator-pending mode automatically.  If you don't want these key mappings,
define |g:textobj_function_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is
loaded (e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use
|:TextobjFunctionDefaultKeyMappings| to redefine these key mappings.  This
command doesn't override existing {lhs}s unless [!] is given.

	{lhs}	{rhs}				~
	-----	---------------------------	~
	af	<Plug>(textobj-function-a)
	if	<Plug>(textobj-function-i)




==============================================================================
API						*textobj-function-api*

textobj-function uses the following function to know the range to select
a function which is appropriate for the current buffer.  See
after/ftplugin/*/textobj-function.vim in the archives of textobj-function for
examples.

b:textobj_function_select({object-type})	*b:textobj_function_select()*
		Return a list to indicate the range to select a function.  If
		there is no function to select, return 0 instead.

		{object-type} specifies the type of object to select.  This
		can be one of the following values:

			Value	Meaning		~
			----------------------- ~
			'a'	"a function"
			'i'	"inner function"

		The detail of a list to return is as follows:
>
			[{*wise}, {start-position}, {end-position}]
<
		- {*wise} denotes the default type of selection.  Valid values
		  are "v", "V" or "\<C-v>".  The meaning of the values are
		  characterwise, linewise or blockwise.
		- {start-position} denotes the start position of the area to
		  be selected.  The detail of this value is the same as
		  |getpos()|.
		- {end-position} is like {start-position}, but it denotes the
		  end position of the area to be selected.

		In this function, it is allowd to move the cursor to anywhere.
		The cursor will be automatically adjusted or restored after
		calling this function.
