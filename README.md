## Startup

The `startup` directory is basically my `.vimrc`, except separated into
mappings, settings and so on. The borders between a few things are blurry,
though. The reason they're not in `plugin` is because it's necessary to either
load them very early or load them in a specific order. Or, they just haven't
made sense to me as "plugins".

## Personal

The `personal` directory contains small scripts that I don't consider good
plugin material, but are useful anyway.

## WIP

The `wip` directory contains stuff that I'm currently working on. These will
probably be incomplete experiments that I can't build plugins from just yet.

## Projects

The `projects` directory holds "project" files. I use this in combination with
the proj plugin to load some project-specific settings depending on what I'm
working on right now. The `symfony` project file might be my largest, but it's
abandoned, since I'm not writing PHP anymore.
